# CS6110-FinalProject
## Borda Voting with Blockchain

### Object
This code is an implementation of a voting system using blockchain.  The voting protocol used is Borda.  This code is implemented to get the votes of 3 different voters (1,2,3) on 5 different candidates (a,b,c,d,e).  The voters enter their info and are then verified.  The voters then enter their votes which are encrypted and appended to the block chain.  When all the votes are gathered, the Central Authority computes the winner of the Borda Vote and produces visualizations.  

### How to Run Code
Simply run the main.py file.  It contains the main driver function for all of the code included.
